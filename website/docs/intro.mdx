# Introduction

Wazo Platform allows developers to build solutions that fit any business and technical
requirements. Fully open source and based on open Source components, Wazo Platform aims to
provide all the building blocks to create a full-featured, carrier-grade, Programmable
Telecom Infrastructure.

This Open Source project allows you to <strong>build carrier grade programmable IP communication infrastructures</strong>.
You can pick and choose the components you need to build your infrastructures with class 5 features like
<strong>audio and video calls</strong>, chat, call centers, conferences, voicemail, etc.

From our APIs, <strong>integrate any kind of integration</strong> with the platform.
Wazo could integrate with your own billing capabilities or any value-added services
like Speech to Text, A.I. or sentiment analysis.

<strong>Deployable and scalable</strong> on bare metal, virtual machines or containers.

## History

Wazo is a fork of XiVO, which was created in 2005 in France by Sylvain Boily and the company
Proformatique. In 2010, Proformatique merged with Avencall, and Avencall acquired the copyright and
trademark of XiVO.

Sylvain then moved to Quebec City and founded Proformatique, Inc. where the XiVO core development
team worked from 2011 until November 2016.

In November 2016, Proformatique Inc. was shut down and the development team
[forked XiVO to create Wazo](/blog/introducing-wazo). Its first release, Wazo 16.16, was released in
December 2016.
