Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 25.13 release.

## Technical
- **database migrations**: database migrations scripts originating from release 23.05 and earlier were squashed into a single base migration

## Ongoing Features
- **debian bookworm**: it is high time for wazo to update its underlying OS layer from debian bullseye to debian bookworm; 
  work is ongoing and the first bookworm release is expected to come at some point before the end of the year; 
  see [previous debian dist upgrades](https://wazo-platform.org/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/23-06/bullseye/) for a taste of what an upgrade to the first bookworm-based wazo release should entail

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D25.13).

See you at the next sprint review!
