Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 26.01 release.

As usual for the first release of the year following the holidays, the 26.01 release is light, and mostly involves some technical debt work with low visible impact on the product.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D26.01).

See you at the next sprint review!
