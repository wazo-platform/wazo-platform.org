## Asterisk and Wazo Prompts {#asterisk-and-wazo-prompts}

Languages and prompts are recorded by several studios. The information for those languages are:

- French : Super Sonic productions (supersonicprod@wanadoo.fr)
- English : Asterisk voice (allison@theasteriskvoice.com)
- German : ATS studio
- Italian : ATS studio

Prompts transcripts are listed in [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/wazo/wazo/)
(\*-prompts). You may translate them there.

The prompts used in Wazo are stored in [wazo-sounds](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-sounds)
git repository. You may also want to
