To debug asterisk crashes or freezes, you need the following debug packages on your Wazo:

Follow the instructions in the sub-section that matches the version you are currently using.

### Wazo >= 19.13

1. Set your Wazo version:

   ```shell
   export WAZO_VERSION=<current-wazo-version>

## So There is a Problem with Asterisk. Now What ? {#so-there-is-a-problem-with-asterisk-now-what}

1.  Find out the time of the incident from the people most likely to know
2.  Determine if there was a segfault

    1.  The command `grep segfault /var/log/syslog` should return a line such as the following:

        ```log
        Oct 16 16:12:43 xivo-1 kernel: [10295061.047120] asterisk[1255]: segfault at e ip b751aa6b sp b5ef14d4 error 4 in libc-2.11.3.so[b74ad000+140000]
        ```

    2.  Note the exact time of the incident from the segfault line.
    3.  Follow the [Debugging Asterisk Crash](#debugging-asterisk-crash) procedure.

3.  If you observe some of the following common symptoms, follow the
    [Debugging Asterisk Freeze](#debugging-asterisk-freeze) procedure.
    - The output of command `service asterisk status` says Asterisk PBX is running.
    - No more calls are distributed and phones go to `No Service`.
    - Command `core show channels` returns only headers (no data) right before returning
4.  Fetch Asterisk logs for the day of the crash (make sure file was not already logrotated):

    ```shell
    cp -a /var/log/asterisk/full /var/local/`date +"%Y%m%d"`-`hostname`-asterisk-full.log
    ```

5.  Open a new issue on the [bug tracker](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net) with following information
    - Tracker: Bug
    - Status: New
    - Category: Asterisk
    - In versions: The version of your Wazo installation where the crash/freeze happened
    - Subject : `Asterisk Crash` or `Asterisk Freeze`
    - Description : Add as much context as possible, if possible, a scenario that lead to the issue,
      the date and time of issue, where we can fetch logs and backtrace
    - Attach logs and backtrace (if available) to the ticket (issue must be saved, then edited and
      files attached to a comment).
    - **DO NOT** attach the core file publicly! It may contain sensitive information like passwords
      and should only be shared with people you trust.

## Debugging Asterisk Crash {#debugging-asterisk-crash}

When asterisk crashes, it usually leaves a core file in `/var/spool/asterisk/`.

You can create a backtrace from a core file named `core_file` with:

```shell
gdb -batch -ex "bt full" -ex "thread apply all bt" /usr/sbin/asterisk core_file > bt-threads.txt
```

This provides the stack trace(sequence of function calls) for all threads at the time of the crash.

This assumes the binary `/usr/sbin/asterisk` is the same version of asterisk used to generate the
coredump file.

As production asterisk installations typically don't include the debugging symbols necessary to
interpret the coredump, you will need install debug symbol packages alongside the asterisk package.

The `find-dbgsym-packages` tool from the `debian-goodies` package can be used to identify some of
the debug symbol packages available for the dependencies of an executable:

```shell
find-dbgsym-packages /usr/sbin/asterisk
```

### Using docker to build the debugging environment

As analysing a coredump requires the specific asterisk executable used to generate that coredump,
along with all dependencies and their debug symbol packages, as well as the tooling(e.g. gdb), it
can be desirable to have a special-purpose debugging environment that is tailored for the task, and
be able to juggle with multiple debugging environments for different asterisk versions. Using linux
containers is a useful way to manage these isolated environments.

A docker image can be used to create a special-purpose debugging environment. We can expand on
[the dockerfile available in the asterisk repository](https://github.com/wazo-platform/asterisk/blob/master/Dockerfile):

```dockerfile
FROM debian:bullseye
LABEL maintainer="Wazo Maintainers <dev@wazo.community>"

ARG WAZO_RELEASE
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# basic debian utilities
RUN apt-get -q update && apt-get -q -y install \

    asterisk-dbgsym/$WAZO_RELEASE

# create /work volume to mount the coredump file and helper scripts
VOLUME /work

# run gdb by default
CMD ["gdb", "/usr/sbin/asterisk"]
```

Note that `$WAZO_RELEASE` is assumed to be the identifier of a previous release available in the
archive wazo repository, e.g. `wazo-25.07`. If the asterisk version that produced the coredump is
part of the current wazo release, the current stable repository can be used instead:

```Dockerfile
RUN echo "deb http://mirror.wazo.community/debian/ pelican-bullseye main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazo-dist.list
```

The image can be built:

```shell
docker build -t asterisk-debug-env --build-arg WAZO_RELEASE=wazo-25.07 .
```

(substitute `wazo-25.07` with the appropriate wazo release identifier).

That image can then be used to run gdb on the corefile:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/work asterisk-debug-env gdb /usr/sbin/asterisk /work/core_file
```

(`core_file` being the coredump file in the current directory, being mounted to the `/work`
directory in the container). Any output needed from gdb can be placed in the `/work` volume to be
made available in the current directory out of the container.

### ast_coredumper

`ast_coredumper` is a tool provided by the asterisk project that can be used to extract common
information from a coredump file.

As the script is not bundled into the wazo packages, it can be pulled from the
[official asterisk github repository](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/master/contrib/scripts/ast_coredumper),
and marked as executable.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asterisk/asterisk/refs/heads/master/contrib/scripts/ast_coredumper
chmod +x ast_coredumper

ast_coredumper /usr/sbin/asterisk core_file
```

See
[official documentation](https://docs.asterisk.org/Development/Debugging/Getting-a-Backtrace/#running-ast_coredumper-for-crashes).

## Debugging Asterisk Freeze {#debugging-asterisk-freeze}

You can create a backtrace of a running asterisk process with:

```shell
gdb -batch -ex "thread apply all bt" /usr/sbin/asterisk $(pidof asterisk) > bt-threads.txt
```

If your version of asterisk has been compiled with the `DEBUG_THREADS` flag, you can get more
information about locks with:

```shell
asterisk -rx "core show locks" > core-show-locks.txt
```

**Note**: Debugging freeze without this information is usually a lot more difficult.

Optionally, other information that can be interesting:

- the output of `asterisk -rx 'core show channels'`
- the verbose log of asterisk just before the freeze

### Debugging Asterisk Freeze using a core dump

Most of the time Asterisk has been stopped by the `wazo-res-freeze-check` module and a core file
will be available in `/var/spool/asterisk`. The first step is to figure out which threads were
blocking each other.

#### Finding the culprits

1. Extract all back traces from the core dump

```shell
gdb -batch -ex "bt full" -ex "thread apply all bt" /usr/sbin/asterisk core_file > bt-threads.txt
```

2. Find mutexes being waited on

   - By mutex names used in asterisk functions:

   ```shell
   grep -Eo 'mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x[0-9a-z]+' bt-threads.txt | sort | uniq -c
   ```

   ```
       4 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24cc9cfe
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24cca99b
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ccab82
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ccb136
       2 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ccb386
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ccb9a8
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ce0e34
       2 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ce5b51
       9 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24ceca31
       13 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24d0369b
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24d159b5
       20 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x562d24d15bb4
       1 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x7fa1bc3d002a
       10 mutex_name=mutex_name@entry=0x7fa1bce4f2d2
   ```

   - By mutex addresses used in lower level lock handling code:

   ```shell
   grep -Eo 'mutex=0x[0-9a-z]+' bt-threads.txt | sort | uniq -c
   ```

   ```
       1 mutex=0x5575c84f8530
       1 mutex=0x5575c84fbc80
       1 mutex=0x5575c84fc270
       1 mutex=0x5575c851a610
       1 mutex=0x5576017ed180
       1 mutex=0x557601831720
       1 mutex=0x55760197b138
       1 mutex=0x55760197c538
       1 mutex=0x55760197d938
       1 mutex=0x55760197f138
       1 mutex=0x557601980538
       1 mutex=0x5576019c5d60
       11 mutex=0x5576019f8800
       2 mutex=0x557605296000
       1 mutex=0x557605346900
       2 mutex=0x5576058cb800
       1 mutex=0x557605a490e0
       1 mutex=0x5576065c0f30
       2 mutex=0x5576066955b8
       1 mutex=0x7f8d11788148
   ```

This will produce a list of mutex that you can then search for in the `bt-threads.txt` file.

3. Following the locks

To find a cycle, we start with a mutex waited on by a thread, find its owner(the thread currently
holding that lock), move to that owner thread and see if it is itself waiting on a lock, and
continue until we see the same thread again.

Starting with the mutex that is being waited on the most, look at one of the thread waiting on this
lock.

In this example we will start with the mutex `0x562d24d15bb4` which was being waited on by 20
threads at the time of the core dump.

In the `bt-threads.txt` file, search for `0x562d24d15bb4` and stop at any of the matches.

```

Then we want to find the owner of the mutex. Using the address of the underlying `pthread_mutex_t`,
we can find the owner id. This is the `t` field in the second frame.

```sh
gdb /usr/sbin/asterisk core_file
(gdb) p *((pthread_mutex_t *) 0x562d2713de70)
$1 = pthread_mutex_t = {Type = Recursive, Status = Acquired, possibly with waiters, Owner ID = 1677129, Robust = No, Shared = No, Protocol = None}
```

Now back to the `bt-threads.txt` we can search for `1677129` the owner of the `pthread_mutex_t`

```sh
% grep '1677129' bt-threads.txt
[New LWP 1677129]
Thread 135 (Thread 0x7fa137aa0700 (LWP 1677129)):
```

Now back to `gdb` we can move to thread 135 and repeat the same process.

At a certain point you will notice a loop between the threads. All threads that are part of the loop
are part of the freeze.

**Note**:A gdb script can be used to automatically iterate over all threads and locks and identify
the owner of each lock:

```gdb
# examine-mutexes.gdb
python
import gdb
def examine_mutexes():
    inferior = gdb.selected_inferior()
    for thread in inferior.threads():
        thread.switch()
        frame = gdb.selected_frame()
        while frame:
            frame.select()
            if frame.name() in ("__GI___pthread_mutex_lock", "__pthread_cond_wait_common"):
                if (mutex_addr := gdb.lookup_symbol("mutex")[0].value(frame)):
                    mutex = mutex_addr.cast(gdb.lookup_type("pthread_mutex_t").pointer()).dereference()
                    print('mutex addr', mutex_addr, ' owner', mutex['__data']['__owner'])
            frame = frame.older()
examine_mutexes()
end
```

```sh
gdb -batch -x examine-mutexes.gdb /usr/sbin/asterisk core_file
```

#### Other threads

Some threads in Asterisk are not started from a user interaction. Once you found which threads are
locked, it can be interesting to find out what triggered the current threads.

In this example on frame 5 we can see that we are most likely in a scheduled thread because of the
name of the function `bridge_channel_ind_thread` searching through the code we can find the type of
it's parameter and then print it using the appropriate cast to find the calling function.

```gdb

#8  0x00007f1bedbac4cf in clone () at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/clone.S:95
```

Using the `data` parameter from frame 5 and the type from the source code.

```sh
gdb /usr/sbin/asterisk core_file
(gdb) p *((struct ast_bridge_channel *) 0x7fa18c4acc00)
$1 = ... bridge = 0x7fa18c16b080, ...
```

Then searching bt-threads we can find which thread scheduled this one using the bridge address.

#### Getting the log for this freeze

Using the thread ID we can filter the full log to extract only the lines from the threads we are
interested in.

```shell
grep -E '(1681007|1680934|1680912)' full
```

## Recompiling Asterisk {#recompiling-asterisk}

It's relatively straightforward to recompile the asterisk version of your Wazo with the
`DEBUG_THREADS` and `DONT_OPTIMIZE` flag, which make debugging an asterisk problem easier.

The steps are:

1.  Uncomment the `deb-src` line for the Wazo sources:

    ```shell
        sed -i 's/^# *deb-src/deb-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xivo*

    ```

2.  Fetch the asterisk source package:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ~/ast-rebuild
    cd ~/ast-rebuild
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y build-essential
    apt-get source asterisk
    ```

3.  Install the build dependencies:

    ```shell
    apt-get build-dep -y asterisk
    ```

4.  Enable the `DEBUG_THREADS` and `DONT_OPTIMIZE` flag:

    ```shell
    cd <asterisk-source-folder>
    vim debian/rules
    ```

5.  Update the changelog by appending `+debug1` in the package version:

    ```shell
    vim debian/changelog
    ```

6.  Rebuild the asterisk binary packages:

    ```shell
    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
    ```

This will create a couple of .deb files in the parent directory, which you can install via `dpkg`.

### Recompiling a vanilla version of Asterisk (Wazo \< 17.17) {#recompiling-a-vanilla-version-of-asterisk-wazo-17.17}

It is sometimes useful to produce a "vanilla" version of Asterisk, i.e. a version of Asterisk that
has none of the Wazo patches applied, to make sure that the problem is present in the original
upstream code. This is also sometimes necessary before opening a ticket on the
[Asterisk issue tracker](https://issues.asterisk.org).

The procedure is similar to the one described above. Before calling `dpkg-buildpackage`, you just
need to:

1.  Make sure `quilt` is installed:

    ```shell
    apt-get install -y quilt
    ```

2.  Unapply all the currently applied patches:

    ```shell
    quilt pop -a
    ```

3.  Remove all the lines in the `debian/patches/series` file:

    ```shell
    truncate -s0 debian/patches/series
    ```

When installing a vanilla version of Asterisk, you'll need to stop `monit`, otherwise it will
restart asterisk every few minutes.

### Recompiling a vanilla version of Asterisk (Wazo \>= 19.13) {#recompiling-a-vanilla-version-of-asterisk-wazo-19.13}

It is sometimes useful to produce a "vanilla" version of Asterisk, i.e. a version of Asterisk that
has none of the Wazo patches applied, to make sure that the problem is present in the original
upstream code. This is also sometimes necessary before opening a ticket on the
[Asterisk issue tracker](https://issues.asterisk.org).

Wazo offers a vanilla version of Asterisk, compiled with the `DONT_OPTIMIZE` flag. This makes filing
bug reports to Asterisk much easier.

Note that this version of Asterisk loses some features that are specific to Wazo. The removed
features include:

- Queue skill-based routing
- Voicemail message consultation via REST API
- Call transfers via REST API

To install the vanilla version of Asterisk (replace 19.13 with your current version of Wazo):

```shell
wazo-dist -a wazo-19.13
apt-get update
apt-get install -t wazo-19.13 asterisk-vanilla asterisk-vanilla-dbgsym
xivo-fix-paths-rights
wazo-dist -m pelican-bullseye
```

This command should replace the `asterisk` package with `asterisk-vanilla`.

Once the packages are installed, you can reproduce the crash and extract the backtrace logs from the
core dump file. Those file may then be used to file a bug report to Asterisk.

To revert this modification, reinstall `asterisk` (replace 19.13 with your current version of Wazo):

```shell
wazo-dist -a wazo-19.13
apt-get update
apt-get install -t wazo-19.13 asterisk
xivo-fix-paths-rights
wazo-dist -m pelican-bullseye
```

## Running Asterisk under Valgrind {#running-asterisk-under-valgrind}

1.  Install valgrind:

    ```shell
    apt-get install valgrind
    ```

2.  Recompile asterisk with the `DONT_OPTIMIZE` flag.
3.  Edit `/etc/asterisk/modules.conf` so that asterisk doesn't load unnecessary modules. This step
    is optional. It makes asterisk start (noticeably) faster and often makes the output of valgrind
    easier to analyze, since there's less noise.
4.  Edit `/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf` and comment the `highpriority` option. This step is optional.
5.  Stop monit and asterisk:

    ```shell
    monit quit
    service asterisk stop
    ```

6.  Stop all unneeded Wazo services. For example, it can be useful to stop wazo-calld, so that it
    won't interact with asterisk via the AMI.
7.  Copy the valgrind.supp file into /tmp. The valgrind.supp file is located in the contrib
    directory of the asterisk source code.
8.  Execute valgrind in the /tmp directory:

    ```shell
    cd /tmp
    valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=valgrind.txt --suppressions=valgrind.supp --vgdb=no asterisk -G asterisk -U asterisk -fnc
    ```

Note that when you terminate asterisk with Control-C, asterisk does not unload the modules before
exiting. What this means is that you might have lots of "possibly lost" memory errors due to that.
If you already know which modules is responsible for the memory leak/bug, you should explicitly
unload it before terminating asterisk.

Running asterisk under valgrind takes a lots of extra memory, so make sure you have enough RAM.
