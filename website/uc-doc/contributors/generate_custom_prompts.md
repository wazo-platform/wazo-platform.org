title: Generate your own prompts
---

If you want your Wazo to speak in your language that is not supported by Wazo, and you don't want to
record the whole package of sounds in a studio, you may generate them yourself with some
text-to-speech services.

The following procedure will generate prompts for `pt_BR` (portuguese from Brazil) based on the
Google TTS service.

**Note**: There are two sets of prompts: the Asterisk prompts and the Wazo prompts. This procedure
only covers the Wazo prompts, but it may be adapted for Asterisk prompts.

1.  Create an account on Transifex and join the team of translation of Wazo.
2.  Translate the prompts in the wazo-prompt resource.
3.  Go to [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/wazo/wazo/) and download the file on your Wazo.
    You should have a file named like `for_use_wazo_wazo-prompt_pt_BR.ini`.
4.  On your Wazo, download the tool to automate the use of Google TTS:

    ```shell
    wget https://github.com/zaf/asterisk-googletts/raw/master/cli/googletts-cli.pl
    chmod +x googletts-cli.pl
    ```

5.  Then run the following script to generate the sound files (set `LANGUAGE` and `COUNTRY` to your
    own language):

    ```shell
    LANGUAGE=pt
    COUNTRY=BR
    mkdir -p wav/{digits,letters}
    cat for_use_wazo_wazo-prompt_${LANGUAGE}_${COUNTRY}.ini | while IFS='=' read file text ; do
      echo $file
      ./googletts-cli.pl -t "$text" -l ${LANGUAGE}-${COUNTRY} -s 1.4 -r 8000 -o wav/$file.wav
    done
    ```

6.  Install the prompts on your system:

    ```shell
    mv wav /usr/share/asterisk/sounds/${LANGUAGE}_${COUNTRY}
    ```

Note that this last modification may be erased after running `wazo-upgrade`.

And that's it, you can configure a user to use your new language and he will hear the prompts in
your language. You may also want to use the
[wazo-confd HTTP API](/uc-doc/administration/users/csv_import) to mass-update your users.
