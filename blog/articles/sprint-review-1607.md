Hello XiVO community! Here comes the release of XiVO 16.07!

New features in this sprint
---------------------------

**Asterisk**: Asterisk has been updated to version 13.9.1


Community contributions
-----------------------

**Tutorials**: Many thanks for Ward Mundy from [Nerd Vittles](http://nerdvittles.com?p=18468) for creating many new tutorials for XiVO.


Ongoing features
----------------

**Call Transfers**: We are working on a new API for managing call transfers. This will offer third parties more flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows, such as a Web Switchboard. In addition, this new API should solve a number of bugs related to call transfers. In this iteration we started working on a version of the CTI server that uses this new API for all XiVO Client transfers.

See you at the next sprint review!
