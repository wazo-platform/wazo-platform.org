It was a great pleasure to present the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project at
SolutionsLinux2010 (the largest Linux fair in France yearly) on last
week and we had several discussions about the architecture choosen for
the IPBX and the interfaces / functionnalities.

We had some great feedbacks from different VoIP projects and deployment
feedbacks that will help us understand the needs from the market.

The next steps are now for the OpenHardware community, to present our
prototyping feddbacks and the detailed architecture that we are
targeting.

Finally, we will presenting soon the work done on the potential
OpenHardware licence that we want to use based on a mixed between
trademarks and CreativeCommons licences.
