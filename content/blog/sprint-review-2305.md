Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 23.05 release.

Since Wazo Platform 19.13, the only compatible version of Debian has been Debian 10 (Buster). This release, 23.05, is intended to be the last to support Debian 10 (Buster).
Next release(23.06) will be based on Debian 11(Bullseye).
It is recommended to upgrade to 23.05 before that release to avoid a large changeset and minimize upgrade issues.

## Technical Features

- **Asterisk**: Asterisk has been upgraded to 20.2.1. See the [Asterisk release announcement](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-20-2-1-now-available/)

## Ongoing Features

- **Major upgrade**: We are preparing the upgrade to Debian 11 Bullseye.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D23.05).

See you at the next sprint review!
