As we move forward on the validation of the different functionnal block
of the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project, we can now describe more
precisely the different blocks and the eco-system of the project.

The functionnal blocks are numbered now as followed for the validation
and PCB Schematics :

~~~
1-CPU
2-ISDN
3-FXO-FXS
4-UART
5-EEPROM
6-ETH
7-SD-USB
8-SATA
9-LEDS
10-DDR2
11-SPI-FLASH
12-CPU-JTAG
13-PWR
14-CLK
15-RST
~~~


We will then follow-up on the documentation of the project for the
validation and PCB Schematics with this numbering allowing
sub-documentation and discussion for each functionnal block.

Concerning the eco-system of the project, the figure below describes the
different steps to go to the production of the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware
product.

The next posts will describe the validation of the communication between
the CPU[1](1 "1") and the ISDN[2](2 "2") and the FXO-FXS[3](3 "3").
