Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 21.01 release.

## New features in this release

* **Call recording**: Until Wazo Platform 21.01, call recording was either on or off, for all calls of a user. In 21.01, new options have been added to control which calls are automatically recorded: placed or received calls, as well as internal or external (i.e. through a trunk) phone calls.

* **Call recording**: There is now a new API to start or stop recording a call.

## Technical features

* **Asterisk**: Asterisk has been updated to 18.1.1. See the Asterisk release announcement for [18.0.0](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-18-0-0-now-available/), and [18.1.1](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-13-38-1-16-15-1-17-9-1-and-18-1-1-now-available-security/).

## Ongoing features

* **Call recording**: we are working to improve the Wazo Platform API to easily get call recordings.
