Dear XIOH followers,

**As we have passed the CE marking certification, we have finalized the
label that we will have on our product with the revelant informations
necessary to identify the product once on the market :**

![XIOH\_Label](/images/blog/XIOHv5/.P1070110_m.jpg "XIOH_Label, mar. 2013")

-   **"XIOH - version 5"** : the name of the product and the hardware
    version
-   **"S/N : XIOH-5-1236-29"** ; the serial number including the
    hardware version (5), the production batch (1236) and the number in
    this batch (29)
-   **"AC input: 100-240V\~, 4-2A, 60-50Hz"** : indication on the power
    requirements used by our ATX 180W power supply
-   **"Manufacturer :Avencall"** : the name of the manufacturer (that
    could be different is different production project)
-   **"Sources : http://0001-0001.okey.ohanda.org"** : the OHANDA
    trademark is our legal umbrella for this OpenHardware
    project/product and a direct link to the GIT repository of our
    hardware and software files is indicated on the label. This will
    help the customers and users getting information on the hardware,
    contacting us and sharing information
-   **"Made in France"** : we are currently producing in France (i.e.
    locally as we are based here) but we would rather talk about local
    production to track down the carbone footprint of our product from
    components sourcing to cabling and packaging
-   **Differents logos** including the "CE" (1) and RoHS process of
    production as well as the OHANDA logo.
