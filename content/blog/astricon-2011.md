Avencall was present at the world famous Asterisk conference:
**Astricon2011**. This year the conferencewas held in Denver, Colorado
from October 24th to 27th.

Throughout the week we've met people from many different background:
software developers, enterprise IT,system integrators, decision makers
and much more. During AstriDevCon, a special day for developers only,we
discussed with Asterisk main developers about technical aspect of the
software and what next is coming into Asterisk.

The second day was marked by fellow developers delivering presentations
about the internal mechanic of thecore and subsystems of asterisk. We
also attended talks about the much-awaited **AsteriskSCF** (Scalable
Communication Framework) which is quite promising for building high-end
telecommunication services.

On the third day, we had the pleasure to present the XiVO IPBX
OpenHardware project and Avencall in general. The presentation generated
a lot of positive feedbacks and people came to us to deepen the
discussion about the technical side and also the business model
surrounding the XiVO open platform. **All this curiosity and eager was
just another proof that we are going in the right direction.**

All in all, it was much fun to meet other enthusiasts from many
different horizon gathering around a powerful technology: Asterisk, and
to share our passion about technology.

**We are already looking forward the next Astricon !**
