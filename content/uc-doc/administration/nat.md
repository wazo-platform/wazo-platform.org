## What is NAT?

NAT (Network Address Translation) allows multiple devices to share the same public IP address. This
is a very common setup, since there are not enough IPv4 for all devices in the world. When NAT is
used, there are two networks involved: the private network (one private address for each device) and
the public network (one public address shared for all devices).

## Phones are behind a NAT device

In this scenario, we consider that:

- the Wazo Platform has a public IP address
- the phones using the Wazo Platform are behind a NAT device, sharing a common IP address.

### The problem

A call is established between the phone and the Wazo Platform, but the phone can't hear any voice
coming in.

Explanation: Since the phones are in a private network, they only know their private address and
port, not their public address and port. SIP phones will send their private address and port in the
SIP messages, and the Wazo Platform will send the voice packets to the private IP address and port
of the phone. However, the private address and port of the phone is not reachable from the Wazo
Platform: they are only valid in the private network of the phone. So when Wazo Platform sends the
packets back to the phone, the packets are dropped.

### Solutions

- Wazo Platform should already handle this situation correctly by default.

- You may need to add the following options in the `global` SIP template or directly on a line /
  trunk:

  - `rtp_symmetric` = `yes`
  - `rewrite_contact` = `yes`

  These settings instruct Wazo Platform (via Asterisk) to send the voice and SIP packets back to the
  address and port it came from, i.e. the public address and port of the phone.

  Also make sure that the `global` SIP template has no option `force_rport` with a value different
  than `yes`: this is the default value and is the desired value for NAT setups.

## NAT and WebRTC

The WebRTC protocols already handle the NAT scenarios. However, they may need external services to
work in all situations:

- STUN: To get external addresses from a third party
- TURN: To relay the audio/video streams when direct connection is impossible
