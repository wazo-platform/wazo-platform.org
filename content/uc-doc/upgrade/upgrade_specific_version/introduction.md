## What is the point?

Sometimes, you may need to upgrade your Wazo to a specific version, in
case you don\'t want to upgrade to the latest (which is not recommended,
but sometimes necessary).

## Prerequisites

#:warning: These procedures are *complementary* to the upgrade procedure listed in
`version_specific_upgrade`. You must
follow the version-specific procedure *before* running the following
procedures.

Before starting the upgrade, you must have a xivo or Wazo version
greater than 14.18.

- [Upgrade from Wazo < 19.04](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_specific_version/archives-from-wazo-stretch)
- [Upgrade from Wazo > 19.12](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_specific_version/archives-from-wazo-buster)
