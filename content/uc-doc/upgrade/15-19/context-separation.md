title: Context separation
---

Without context separation, you only need one contact source for all the
users of your XiVO.

However, if you need context separation, each context is considered as a
separate independant source of contacts, each with a different context
filter. For this, you need:

-   one contact source per context (a file in
    `/etc/xivo-dird/sources.d`{.interpreted-text role="file"}), so that
    we have a source containing only the contacts from one context
-   one profile per context (equivalent to
    `Services --> CTI Server --> Directories -->
    Direct directories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}) so that
    users in one context only see people from the same context.

Each source should look like this one, e.g. the context is named
`INSIDE`:

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
confd_config:
  host: localhost
  https: false
  port: 9487
  timeout: 4
  verify_certificate: false
  version: '1.1'
first_matched_columns: [exten]
format_columns:
  directory: "R\xE9pertoire XiVO Interne"
  location: '{description}'
  mobile: '{mobile_phone_number}'
  name: '{firstname} {lastname}'
  number: '{exten}'
  sda: '{userfield}'
  voicemail: '{voicemail_number}'
searched_columns: [firstname, lastname, userfield, description]
type: xivo
unique_column: id
name: internal_INSIDE  # <--- each source has a different name, one per context
extra_search_params:
  context: INSIDE      # <--- each source filters users according to one context
```

The parameters in this file have the same effect than
`Configuration --> Directories`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}
and
`Services --> CTI Server --> Directories --> Direct directories`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} put together.

You may generate these config files from
`xivo-confgen dird/sources.yml`. Be sure to have `name` and
`extra_search_params` correct for each source file.

Now that we have our contact sources, we need our search profiles.

Create a new file to override the profiles generated by *xivo-confgen*.
You only need one file, which will define all your profiles at once.

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
xivo-confgen dird/services.yml >> /etc/xivo-dird/conf.d/001-context-separation.yml
```

In this file, there is a list of services (favorites, lookup, \...)
where each profile has a set of sources. You need to match one profile
to the right internal source for each service. For example, to have
context separation between contexts INSIDE and INDOORS:

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
services:
  favorites:
    __default_phone:
      sources: [xivodir, internal, ldaptest, personal]
    __switchboard_directory:
      sources: [xivodir, ldaptest, personal]
    INSIDE:
      sources: [xivodir, internal_INSIDE, ldaptest, personal]   # <--- profile INSIDE uses the source internal_INSIDE
    INDOORS:
      sources: [xivodir, internal_INDOORS, ldaptest, personal]  # <--- profile INDOORS uses the source internal_INDOORS
  lookup:
    __default_phone:
      sources: [xivodir, internal, ldaptest, personal]
    __switchboard_directory:
      sources: [xivodir, ldaptest, personal]
    INSIDE:
      sources: [xivodir, internal_INSIDE, ldaptest, personal]   # <--- same HERE
    INDOORS:
      sources: [xivodir, internal_INDOORS, ldaptest, personal]  # <--- and HERE
```
