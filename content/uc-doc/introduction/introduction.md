Wazo History
============

Wazo is a fork of XiVO, which was created in 2005 in France by Sylvain
Boily and the company Proformatique. In 2010, Proformatique merged with
Avencall, and Avencall acquired the copyright and trademark of XiVO.

Sylvain then moved to Quebec City and founded Proformatique, Inc. where
the XiVO core development team worked from 2011 until November 2016.

In November 2016, Proformatique Inc. was shut down and the development
team [forked XiVO to create
Wazo](http://blog.wazo.community/introducing-wazo.html). Its first
release, Wazo 16.16, was released in December 2016.
